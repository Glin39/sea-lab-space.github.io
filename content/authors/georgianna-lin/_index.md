I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow collaborating with Orson Xu and Noémie Elhadad. My goal is to bridge HCI, AI, machine learning, and human physiology to create end-to-end systems that support holistic health tracking and personalized goal fulfillment. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Toronto where my work focused on how people make sense of rich, multimodal personal data,particularly in women’s health, and how to design tools that empower them to make informed, confident decisions about their well-being. Prior, I earned my B.S. and M.S. at Georgia Institute of Technology.
